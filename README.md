# Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio built with **React** and **Vite** styled using **TailwindCSS**. It showcases work experience, recent projects, and provides a contact form.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – generate a production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the built app

The repository is intentionally lightweight and contains no backend code. Dependencies are listed in `package.json`.
